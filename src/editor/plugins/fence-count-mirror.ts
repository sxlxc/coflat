/**
 * Fenced-div opener/closer colon-count mirror.
 *
 * Coflat's parser requires the closing fence of a div to use the same colon
 * count as the opener (see FORMAT.md and `fenced-div.ts`). When the user edits
 * one fence — typing an extra `:`, deleting one, or rewriting the line — this
 * transaction filter mirrors the new colon count to the partner fence so the
 * div stays well-formed. Without it, single-sided edits would break the parse
 * silently (an opener with no matching closer becomes an unclosed div).
 *
 * Scope:
 * - Only mirrors when exactly one fence (opener XOR closer) was touched.
 *   If the user edited both fences in the same transaction, we don't fight
 *   them.
 * - Skipped for unclosed divs (no closer to mirror to/from) and for changes
 *   already annotated as `fenceOperationAnnotation` or
 *   `programmaticDocumentChangeAnnotation`, to avoid feedback loops with the
 *   block-type picker and other programmatic edits.
